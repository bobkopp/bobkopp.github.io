 Our lab's work has impact beyond the walls of academia. For example:
  
### Sea-level rise
   
 Our paper on Common Era sea-level change ([Kopp et al., 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1517056113)) led the [_New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/science/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change.html?_r=0), was [discussed by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse](http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/time-to-wake-up-ocean-acidification-and-new-englands-marine-life) on the floor of the United States Senate, and was tweeted by [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/barackobama/status/704770760259166208) and [@JohnLegend](https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/701983215817531392). It received [extensive press coverage](https://www.google.com/search?q=kopp+sea-level+common-era&hl=en&gl=us&authuser=0&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A2%2F1%2F2016%2Ccd_max%3A4%2F1%2F2016&tbm=nws#hl=en&gl=us&authuser=0&tbs=cdr:1%2Ccd_min:2%2F1%2F2016%2Ccd_max:4%2F1%2F2016&tbm=nws&q=kopp+sea-level).
 
The framework for probabilistic projections of sea-level rise we developed in [Kopp et al. (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014EF000239) (MATLAB [projection](https://github.com/bobkopp/ProjectSL) and [localization](https://github.com/bobkopp/LocalizeSL/releases) routines available) has been used by stakeholder groups including the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51518), the [Fourth California Climate Assessment](http://docketpublic.energy.ca.gov/PublicDocuments/16-IEPR-04/TN211806_20160614T101823_Creating_Probabilistic_Sea_Leve_Rise_Projections.pdf), the [Third Oregon Climate Assessment](http://www.occri.net/publications-and-reports/third-oregon-climate-assessment-report-2017/), the [California Ocean Science Trust](http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf), the [Washington Coastal Resilience Project](http://www.wacoastalnetwork.com/files/theme/wcrp/SLR-Report-Miller-et-al-2018.pdf), the [State of Maryland](https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/Air/ClimateChange/MCCC/Documents/Sea-LevelRiseProjectionsMaryland2018.pdf), the [State of Delaware](https://www.dgs.udel.edu/projects/determination-future-sea-level-rise-planning-scenarios-delaware), the [State of New Jersey](https://climatechange.rutgers.edu/resources/climate-change-and-new-jersey/nj-sea-level-rise-reports), the [City of Boston](http://climateready.boston.gov/findings), the [New Jersey Climate Change Alliance](http://njadapt.rutgers.edu/resources/nj-sea-level-rise-reports), and the [New Zealand Ministry for the Environment](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/coastal-hazards-and-climate-change-guidance-local-government). This framework also played a significant role in the construction of [Federal sea-level rise projections](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/techrpt83_Global_and_Regional_SLR_Scenarios_for_the_US_final.pdf) for the Fourth National Climate Assessment. Our group and our collaborators are also in discussion with a variety of other stakeholder groups regarding this framework.
 
Our projections have also been incorporated into Climate Central's [Surging Seas](http://sealevel.climatecentral.org/) website.

#### Looking for sea level data?

If you would like to access our sea-level projections for your region at a greater level of detail than is provided by Surging Seas, you may access them in the following ways:

1. For a subset of U.S. sites, [Kopp et al. (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014EF000239)  projections are summarized in the [American Climate Prospectus's](http://www.climateprospectus.org/) [Physical Climate Data Tables](resources/ACP_Science-Data-Tables.xlsx) (XLSX format).  
2. For all the sites considered in [Kopp et al. (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014EF000239), local sea-level rise projections are summarized in [Supplementary Table  7](resources/KoppEtAl2014-Sup-Table7.tsv).
3. A greater range of projections (more years, more quantiles, disaggregated by source, more sets of assumptions) are available through the [LocalizeSL](https://github.com/bobkopp/LocalizeSL) MATLAB package.

Please feel free to contact me if you need assistance.

### Economic risks of climate change
 
 The work in our book [_Economic Risks of Climate Change: An American Prospectus_](http://www.climateprospectus.org/) formed the basis of a series of reports by the [Risky Business Project](http://www.riskybusiness.org), which is co-chaired by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulsen, and former hedge fund investor Tom Steyer. It received [extensive press coverage](https://www.google.com/search?q=climate+and+%28climate-prospectus+or+risky-business%29&hl=en&gl=us&authuser=0&biw=1234&bih=624&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A6%2F1%2F2014%2Ccd_max%3A9%2F1%2F2014&tbm=nws). 
 
This work was cited in the Office of Management and Budget's Analytical Perspectives on President Obama's [FY 2016](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2016-PER/pdf/BUDGET-2016-PER-7-10.pdf) and [FY 2017](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2017-PER/pdf/BUDGET-2017-PER-6-10.pdf) budgets. It was a key source for the Congressional Budget Office's 2016 report [_Potential Increases in Hurricane Damage in the United States_](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51518) and for the Government Accountability Office's 2017 report [_Information on Potential Economic Effects Could Help Guide Federal Efforts to Reduce Fiscal Exposure_](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-17-720).
