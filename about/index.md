Robert Kopp serves at [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) as an associate professor in the [Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences](http://geology.rutgers.edu/) and Associate Director of the [Rutgers Energy Institute](http://rei.rutgers.edu/). I am also a member of the Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and the [Rutgers Climate Institute](http://climatechange.rutgers.edu), and am affiliated with graduate programs in [Atmospheric Sciences](http://atmos.rutgers.edu), [Geological Sciences](http://eps.rutgers.edu), [Oceanography](http://marine.rutgers.edu), [Statistics](http://statistics.rutgers.edu), and [Planning and Public Policy](http://policy.rutgers.edu/).

His scientific and policy [research](/research) interests are guided by the recognition that, over the last two centuries, human civilization has become a geological force; we are inducing planetary environmental conditions like those that Earth has not experienced for millions of years.

His scientific research focuses on employing statistical and process models to integrate diverse geological data sets, with the proximal goal of improving understanding of past Earth system states and the ultimate goals of testing and strengthening models of future global change. One area of particular emphasis is using records of past sea-level changes to improve estimates of ice sheet stability and future sea-level change

His policy-related research focuses on quantifying human impacts on the global climate, assessing the potential of different policies and technologies to mitigate these impacts, and incorporating climate change impacts into benefit-cost and risk management analyses.

He served as the lead scientist for the  [ _American Climate Prospectus: Economic Risks in the United States_](http://www.climateprospectus.org/), the technical analysis underlying the [Risky Business Project](http://www.riskybusiness.org/). He also served on the
[Maryland Climate Change Commission’s sea-level rise expert group](http://www.umces.edu/project/sea-level-along-maryland%E2%80%99s-shorelines-could-rise-2-feet-2050-according-new-report) and was a contributing author to Working Groups 1 and 2 of the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](http://www.ipcc.ch)’s Fifth Assessment Report.

Prior to joining the Rutgers faculty, he served as an [AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow](http://fellowships.aaas.org/) in the
[U.S. Department of Energy](http://www.energy.gov)'s Office of Policy and International Affairs. At the Energy Department, he provided key technical support to the White House-led process on incorporating the social cost of carbon into regulatory analysis and played a leading role in the development and launch of the [Clean Energy Ministerial](http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org)'s appliance and equipment efficiency effort, the [Super-efficient Equipment and Appliance Deployment initiative](http://www.superefficient.org).

Prior to this fellowship, he was a [Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy](http://www.princeton.edu/step/) postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University. He received his Ph.D. in geobiology from Caltech, where his research focused on fossil magnetic bacteria and on the long-term co-evolution of life and climate on planet Earth. He received his S.B. in geophysical sciences from the University of Chicago.

He is a Leopold Leadership Fellow and a recipient of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA)'s Sir Nicholas Shackleton Medal and the American Geophysical Union's William Gilbert Medal.
